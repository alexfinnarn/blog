While looking a “auxiliary batteries” for the first time, [I saw a quote from an article](http://mowgli-adventures.com/camper-van-electrics-explained/) that made me cringe.

> “A major part of any camper van build is the electrical system. Design decisions will affect your van life so it’s vital to get the electric system right at the design stage.”

Being a web developer who has worked on many waterfall, agile-ish projects, I cringe when I see a case of Big Up-Front Design (BUFD). If you haven’t lived in a van already, why plan everything out for your build before you spend a night let alone a week or more living in one?

I was a fan of BUFD initially because it can help to ease anxiety from telling people you are moving into a van “down by the river”. By telling or even showing schematics of what you’re about to build to others, it makes you feel less juvenile while easing into your Peter Pan van life. Buying a van with the notion of “I’ll figure it out when the time comes” is scary, but it does relate a lot to agile vs. BUFD ways of developing a software application. 

### Leaning Agile

I want to lean on the agile side of building out my van rather than the BUFD of having thought out everything, including the electrical systems, before I might even purchase the van.
