If you type that phrase into Google, you will get a multitude of results that usually include lists. Oh how “how to know” article authors love to write articles with lists in them. 7 steps, 12 steps, or 4 steps. Somehow, if I ask myself the questions listed in those steps, I’ll know what I want to do with my life.

The only problem is that all the questions have to do with reason, which is usually a device humans use when they aren’t sure what else to use. Reason always comes after an action has happened, whether that action is a feeling or an event you’ve witnessed or performed. 

I think we’ve all been in situations where we don’t feel quite right and spend an afternoon soul searching in order to try and figure out what’s wrong. The feeling must be telling us something, right? And it probably is. However, once we’ve found a suitable explanation to our bad feeling, we then go back to reason and think we can get by with just that.

### Aren’t You So Lucky

A lot of these articles are written by people who fell into what they are doing through a lot of good intuitions and probably some good mentorship. It’s not that the steps they list are bad ones to read and ponder, but to think everyone can give up jobs they hate to pursue their passions is a fantasy. 

There will always be jobs that most people don’t want or feel excited about that still need done. In commencement addresses, you’ll see a smattering of speakers who deflate graduates balloons by telling them as much.
