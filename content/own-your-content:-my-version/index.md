I forget when I first saw the hashtag #OwnYourContent on Twitter, but I‚Äôll always associate it with the blogging platform, Medium.com. Yes, even this blog post was written on Medium. I thought I would document my process as I went, and I also thought it would be cool, ironic, and way badass to start it on Medium and finish it on my very own personal blog.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still tend to like Medium a lot for the writing experience. Coming to a site that just shows you a white canvas on page load was refreshing. No clunky boxes to move around and arrange. No WYSIWYG buttons‚Ä¶like who actually wants to mess with justification when you‚Äôre writing. Float the image over here, now get the pixel size right‚Ä¶whoops, now figure out how`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>H&nbsp;</strong><a href="#"><span style="color:blue">ello</span></a> World<i>!</i>` happened. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

But then there are the bad things, like paywalls, no choice over feature changes or the buttons you get to use‚Ä¶man do I want to center justify this paragraph right now‚Ä¶and the fact that you don‚Äôt own what you create. I suppose it helps to start this story back when I did own my blog content.

### Alex Gets A¬†Website

I used to own every piece of my digital personality back when I had a website. I guess I had Facebook and Twitter too, but all long-form content, all my actual ideas, all of that stuff was owned by me. The site design, fonts, sidebar widgets‚Ä¶more sidebar widgets. You get the picture. They were all mine.

And all built on top of the fabulous and glorious Drupal 7 CMS platform. I had an interest to be come a web developer at the time, but I hadn‚Äôt obtained a web job. I did insert myself whenever I saw the need for website assistance, and so creating a blog in my spare time made total sense. This way, I‚Äôd have some practice in order to come to the rescue when my job needed a web expert the most.

I fondly remember rounding the edges of the container around my header and content areas. Some repeating background gave me site a papery feel, but it was the gradient and transition to the content area that I remember the most. Oh yeah, and the orange. Orange is my favorite color, and it was pretty awesome to add one of my favorite things to one of my favorite websites‚Ä¶at the time. The only time I see any orange on Medium is when they make the gay pride flag part of their logo.¬†

complaints from others

-   Medium is trying to aggregate your content behind a subscription service. Write because you have something to say with personality, not for page views.
-   centralizing the internet is bad in its own right. Back to the olden days of the internet when it had personality. Blink tags. Space Jam website, table with <br>, gifs, space background, and lots of personality: [https://www.spacejam.com](https://www.spacejam.com/)
-   No control over stats, layouts, metatags, etc.
-   removes the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the content. Doesn‚Äôt lead to other interactions away from blogging
