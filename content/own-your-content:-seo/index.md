Finally, I want to have some sort of analytics data I can use to help drive the focus of the content I create. Via Medium, I know that my most popular blog post ended up being on upgrading a Vue.js application to use the project's new `vue-cli` over a community-based starter kit I had been using. Unfortunately, I haven't foucsed on any Vue-related work since the time I published those posts, but at least I now know which articles I can use to drive visitors to more Vue or general JavaScript blog posts. I'd like to at least get some numbers on page views and a tally of how many readers made it all the way to the bottom of the page.
