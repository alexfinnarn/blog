I like to write blog posts in series. In my mind, I’m always trying to tie my work and professional development goals to higher-level concepts broken down into chunks. I find writing my process down in a journal-like format helps me to understand what I’m doing and why I’m doing what I’m better. 

I recently created a Github repository to track my professional development while at work, but I’ll probably also track things I do outside of work. I think your professional development goals should correlate with what you’re doing in your spare time…or maybe you should get a new job that aligns more with those goals?

You should be allowed to journal/write blog posts while working as they provide some decent documentation and history on certain projects. If a new team member starts work and wants to know a little history on a project I’m trying to get them up to speed on, I can say “read these articles to get a better idea” along with other official documentation and help. 

You should also start trying to write posts as you work once you are “allowed” to do so. I think anyone can make a justification for doing so, especially after you point out that mistake you fixed solely because you were about to publish an article to the general public and didn’t want to look like a fool. You’ll probably link to resources you wouldn’t write down for teammates normally as well. 

Enough about why I’m doing this, let’s get to the exploring.

### php\[arch\] Magazine

The php\[arch\] Magazine \[link\] is a great resource to keep up to date with PHP news. I stumbled upon it by…actually, I have no idea. I thought it was from a Slack channel but I can’t find that now. So, I guess I found it like most people do: by clicking so many links and having so many open tabs you develop “internet amnesia”.

The article that drew me in was about Generics in PHP…oh yeah, now I remember how I found it. My amnesia is finally cured thanks to RFCs! Even if they never make it into a language it’s nice to know that they can cure amnesia. Who knew? Actually, now I have “Twitter amnesia”, dammit.

The code for generic types looked a lot like what I was learning in my exploration of TypeScript \[link to other blog posts\].
