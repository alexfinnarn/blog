When you feel like it.

When I think of the title of this post, I’m referring to moving on from a job, but we have to move on from everything in life at some point, even life itself. While we’re not moving, we dream of moving, and in transit, we dream of rest. 

Almost everyone looks at the rock star lifestyle filled with travel and enviously gushes trying to put themselves in the rock star’s shoes going from city to city and seeing the sites. Everyone except the rockstar, that is. I can’t claim to own a stage blistering behind 2000 watts of raw sexiness, but I can claim to have been travelling around the West Coast for the last couple months and living out of a bag for the previous two months to that. I’ve basically been living the life of an unknown rock schmohawk for the past four months, and I think it’s time for me to move on.

### Keep Carrying It With You

While I want to move on from not knowing where I’ll sleep tonight or work tomorrow…both of which are still undecided today as of 4:30 PM…I don’t want to forget my feeling of longing for a slower pace of life. Forgetting that feeling is what makes me want to move on from my static, sedentary life towards greener pastures that never end up being that much greener than before.
